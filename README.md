![main screen][1]

**ToDoList** is an application where you can plan your tasks. The application allows you to *create* tasks, *complete* them, *edit* and *delete*.

## Task creation ##

![empty state][2]

In order to create a task you need to click on the **CREATE** button.  After that a modal window will open in which there will be *3 fields*.

![create card][3]

The first field indicates *the name* of the future task. For example, *do a test task for [JS_BAND_INTERNSHIP]*.  **THIS IS A REQUIRED FIELD.**

In the second field, a *description* of the task.  For example, *make a ToDoList.  Deadline November 3.*

In the third field, you can select the *priority* of the task.  There is a choice between **high/normal/low**.  The **default** is **high**.

In order to save the task, you need to press **SAVE** and the card fits on the main screen.

![save card][4]

If you change your mind, you can click on the **CANCEL** button.

## Work with card ##

And so, now you have one task.  You can *complete*, *edit* and *delete* it.

To do this, click on three points. A submenu will open:

- the **DONE** button *executes* or *cancels* a task.

![done button][6]

![done card][7]

- the **EDIT** button allows you to fix the task.  When clicked, a modal window opens in which you can *change* all the data and then save **SAVE**.

![edit button][8]

![edit modal][9]

![edited card][10]

- the **DELETE** button *deletes* the task.

![delete button][11]

![empty][12]

## Filters ##

The application has the ability to filter the tasks shown.This can be done according to three criteria:
![screen][15]

1. **Search** - searches for cards by table of contents
    ![search][13]
2. **Filter by done** and open cards.
    ![done filter][14]
3. **Filter by task priority**.
    ![priority filter][16]

These three filters can be used together.

![two filters][17]
![three filters][18]

***PS:** all cards are saved when you reload the page and close the browser.  To completely clear the list, and not delete it by one task, just click on the header of contents of the ToDoList application.*
